# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction – End-to-End Data Science & MLOps Project

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project implements a **complete end-to-end Data Science and MLOps pipeline** to predict student academic performance using Machine Learning. The solution covers **data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, CI/CD automation, and cloud deployment on AWS**.

The application is containerized using **Docker**, automated using **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines**, and deployed on **AWS EC2**, enabling real-time predictions through a web interface.
